<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><em>Tango is inscribed in 2009 (4.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible
Cultural Heritage of Humanity, jointly by Argentina and Uruguay</em></p>

<p>The Argentinian and Uruguayan tradition of the Tango, now familiar
around the world, was developed by the urban lower classes in
Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the Rio de la Plata basin.
Among this mix of European immigrants to the region, descendents
of African slaves and the natives of the region known as &quot;<em>criollos</em>&quot;,
a wide range of customs, beliefs and rituals were merged and transformed
into a distinctive cultural identity.
As one of the most recognizable embodiments of that identity,
the music, dance and poetry of tango both embodies and encourages
diversity and cultural dialogue.
It is practised in the traditional dance halls of Buenos Aires and
Montevideo, spreading the spirit of its community across the globe
even as it adapts to new environments and changing times.
That community today includes musicians, professional and amateur
dancers, choreographers, composers, songwriters, teachers of the art
and the national living treasures who embody the culture of tango.
Tango is also incorporated into celebrations of national heritage in
Argentina and Uruguay, reflecting the widespread embrace of this popular
urban music.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Decides</em> that, from the information provided in Nomination
File 00258, the <strong>Tango</strong> satisfies the criteria for inscription on
the Representative List, as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>R.1:   The Tango is a musical genre that includes dance, music,
poetry and singing, and is considered one of the main manifestations
of identity for the inhabitants of the Río de la Plata region;</p>

<p>R.2:   Inscription of the element on the Representative List would
contribute to visibility of intangible cultural heritage and a deeper
understanding of the Tango as a regional expression resulting from
the fusion of several cultures;</p>

<p>R.3:   The two nominating States have presented a number of joint and
individual safeguarding measures for the element by which the
communities and the authorities commit to the creation of specialized
training and documentation centres, as well as the establishment of
an orchestra, museums and preservation trusts;</p>

<p>R.4:   The nomination of the element benefitted from the continuous
participation of the Uruguayan and Argentinean communities through
meetings, seminars, interviews and workshops, and community
representatives have signed documents to mark their free, prior and
informed consent;</p>

<p>R.5:   The element is included in the inventories of intangible
cultural heritage that are being elaborated in Uruguay and Argentina.</p>

<h3>Intangible cultural heritage inventorying sees results in Argentina</h3>

<p><em>27 September 2013 Argentina</em></p>

<p>Tango bearers, government officials and members of concerned
non-governmental organizations have been making steady progress
since April 2013 in drawing up intangible heritage inventories,
considered a priority safeguarding measure by the tango community
in Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>Guided by the UNESCO-trained expert, Ms Mónica Lacarrieu, the
inventory team chose, among the different musical, poetic and human
elements of the practice of tango, to focus on milongas, the popular
evenings where men and women gather in local clubs to dance the tango
and the music that carries that same name.
From April to November, after having received theoretical training on
basic notions of the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the
Intangible Cultural Heritage, the team is interviewing a wide range of
people and governmental and non-governmental organizations related
with the world of milongas.
On Thursday 26 September in Buenos Aires the tenth biweekly
coordination meeting takes place to plan next steps, analyse and
improve the inventorying process, coordinate its work and assess
the intermediate results.</p>

<p>This work constitutes the third phase of the sub-regional project
‘Living Heritage’ currently implemented in Argentina, Paraguay and
Uruguay thanks to the generous support of UNESCO/Japan Funds-in-Trust
for Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage.
It is part of UNESCO’s global strategy for strengthening national
capacities for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage.</p>
